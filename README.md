# Course--Introduction-to-Node.js
## What is NodeJs
Node JS is a server-side JavaScript language. Port of chrome V8 engin to desktop. NodeJs does have a dependance manager. make a run time environment for JavaScript outside of the browser.
- Open source runtime
	- if you writing code in bash. you are in a base runtime
	- if you writing code in ruby. you are in a ruby runtime.
	- mean: it's own environment and that self-encapsulated.
- Built on chrome's V88 JavaScript engine
	- V8 engine compile JavaScript code and convert to matchin code and matchin is read the code.
	- other browser specific JS engine
		- SpiderMonkey: Mozilla JavaScript
		- Webkit: Safari
		- Chakra: Internet Explorer
		- V8 : Google
- Node js is created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.

## What can i create with NodeJs
Any think can do with JavaScript. like 
- Tooling (build, automation, etc)
	- like, automate deployment, version.
- API's (REST, Realtime, etc)
	- like - REST APIs AND GraphQL APIs, realtime API like web sockets.
	- Node high concurrency because of its event loop architecture.
- CDNs
	- Mean: some assets are delivered to your customers as fast as possible.
- Shareable libraries
	- The community is big. People Create libraries and modules and share them with people.
- Desktop applications
	- Use Electrons, SWJS and etc. to make desktop application
- IOT (Internet of things)
	- so many frameworks for IOT devices and the JavaScript Robotics & IoT Platform

		- [RaspBerry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- Pretty much anything because node is on everything now


## Installing NodeJs

### From NodeJs Source
- this is a easiest way to install nodejs. limits: many version of nodejs available, one root place in your computer and can not put another version only manually do this work. Can caues permission errors.

### Using NVM (node version manager)
Recommended. allows you to run many versions of node whenever and doesn't mess up permissions. 


## Running Nodejs code
How to evaluate your JavaScript file in terminal. Two way to evaluate the code.

### Interactive REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)
- Like browser console
- Just type the node command with no argument
Like this in terminal: 

```
$ node
> var name = 'Aman Silawat';
undefined
> name
'Aman Silawat'
> 
````

### CLI Executable
Execute your node app

```
$ node path/file-name.js
```

## Installing Node.js from the source
- install Nodejs thorough official site: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Select your platform and node version. like windows, macOS
	- LTS version mean: life time support
	- Current version mean: no life time support

## Installing Node.js with NVM
Node js created by some foundation or some paid company. NodeJs is open source [git source](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## First Exercise

create a file `code.js`
```js
console.log('hello NodeJs');
```

Code run in `terminal`
```
$ node code.js
hello NodeJs
```

## Node.js Modules
### Browser vs Nodejs
|Browser				|Nodejs						|Description													|
|:--					|:--						|:-														|
|Build Interactive apps for the web	|Build server side apps and scripts		|make visual things in chrome but in not no visual graphical thing						|
|DOM					|Nope, no GUI (can virtualize: fake DOM)	|In browser Combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and rendering the DOM OR CSSOM					|
|Window					|No window, but does have a global		|In browser fetch, alert, location and history but in Nodejs have another global				|
|Fragmentation				|Versioned, so no fragmentation			|Diffrent browser and diffrent specification. In browser [Can i use](https://caniuse.com/)				|
|optional modules (es6)			|Required modules (commonjs +)			|[ECMAScript 6](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/), [CommonJs](https://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html)	|
|Cannot access filesystem		|Can access filesystem				|Browser doesn't use filesystem For security risk but in Nodejs use filesystem.					|
|Async					|Async						|Both async													|
|					|No browser based APIs				|No browser based APIs in NodeJs.										|

### Globals
Browser create your own global.

- **process** - has information about the environment the program is running in
	```
	$ console.log(process)
	```

	I will get this creazy object
	```
	process {
		version: 'v15.3.0',
		versions: {
			node: '15.3.0',
			v8: '8.6.395.17-node.22',
			uv: '1.40.0',
			zlib: '1.2.11',
			brotli: '1.0.9',
			ares: '1.16.1',
			modules: '88',
			nghttp2: '1.41.0',
			napi: '7',
			llhttp: '2.1.3',
			openssl: '1.1.1g',
			cldr: '37.0',
			icu: '67.1',
			tz: '2020a',
			unicode: '13.0'
		},
		arch: 'x64',
		//..
	//..
	}
	```
	Get all the information about the process. So it includes things about the machine, cores, name, path and location,  environment verables and etc.


- **require** - function to find and use modules in current module
	NodeJs uses commanJS. It is a module pattern. Get file or a function and some other stuff through module.

- **__dirname** - the current directory path.

	Use `__dirname` like this create a file in `code.js`
	```
	console.log(__dirname);
	```

	Run the `code.js` file in your terminal.
	```
	$ node code.js
	/home/aman/frontend/Course--Introduction-to-Node.js
	```

- **module** - information about current module, methods or making module consumable
	Every code or file in NodeJs is a module. this feature is by default in NodeJs

	For Example 
	```
	$ node
	> console.log(module)
	Module {
	id: '<repl>',
	path: '.',
	exports: {},
	filename: null,
	loaded: false,
	children: [],
	paths: [
		'/home/aman_silawat/frontend/Course--Introduction-to-Node.js/repl/node_modules',
		'/home/aman_silawat/frontend/Course--Introduction-to-Node.js/node_modules',
		'/home/aman_silawat/frontend/node_modules',
		'/home/aman_silawat/node_modules',
		'/home/node_modules',
		'/node_modules',
		'/home/aman_silawat/.node_modules',
		'/home/aman_silawat/.node_libraries',
		'/usr/local/lib/node'
	]
	}
	```

- **global** - like window, its the "global" object. Almost NEVER use this.
	when use the global?
	We should use global only to test the code other never use the global.






### What are modules?

Module like encapsulated code. A module is a separate unit. Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope, each module can be placed in a separate .js file under a separate folder.

```
var module1 = (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
  // your node js code in a file
})

var module2 = (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname){
  // your node js code in another file
}) 
```
This course is written by node.js. only five parameter use in this function because these parameter value pass in function with different value.


### Modules in Nodejs

- NodeJs uses commonJs for its module system.
- As the author, you decide how and what to expose from your modules, to other modules.


```js
const add = (num, num2) => {
	//..
}
const notPublic = () => {}
module.exports = add
```
Which value must be returned in the model. `notPublic` functions are a private function, it does not expose this function.

Use many patter in `module.export`. this called name exports.
```js
module.exports = {add(){}, think(){}, value: 1}
```

Export only on thing. This called default export.
```js
const add = (num, num2) => {}
module.exports = add
```

Export is very helpful for **performance** reasons like tree shaking. The dependency tree to figure out what to bundle in your app and what not bundled. Developer is understand, what dependency public and what dependency private.

Add another property in **module**
```js
module.export = {value: 1}
module.export.more = {value2: 10}
```

### Using modules

- The Nodejs runtime injects another global, require.
- This function takes a relative path to the module that you want to consume, and synchronously loads it by returning whatever the target module exported.

#### Example:
[default export module](https://github.com/AmanSilawat/Course--Introduction-to-Node.js/tree/master/module/import-node-module/default-exports)
[name export module](https://github.com/AmanSilawat/Course--Introduction-to-Node.js/tree/master/module/import-node-module/name-exports)
